					No action to buy the items only view more detail. This is to pull users in to make them want to read more about the item on display. The item highlighted is shown on the main image the other items can be seen to the right of the main item.</p>

				<p><strong>Critique:</strong><br>
					Item is in the center of the page and is bright and noticable. The list on the right makes it easier for the user to skim through the featured items and see what they are. Hovering over the other items changed the main image to the items image so the user can see it and if it interests them.</p>
